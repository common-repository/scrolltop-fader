Add a nifty scroll to the top of the page feature with: ScrollTop Fader.

== Description ==
Scroll Top Fader adds a convenient scroll to the top feature to the front-end of your website. It includes a number of really nice configurable features that you can fine tune to your needs. Images auto-size from 30 pixels to 50 pixels depending on the screen size the visitor has to ensure they are not too intrusive. In other words, visitors with larger screens, such as desktop computers would see an image that is 40 to 50 pixels. A visitor using a tablet would see one that is in the 35 to 40 pixels range. A visitor using a mobile phone would see on that is 30 to 35 pixels. All depending on the screen size of the device they happen to be using.

* Change the image background color

* Option to use transparency

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any limitations? =

Yes, but not many and you will still be able to achieve a really nice effect.

You may hover your mouse over, or tap the ?'s in the plugin settings page, and it will tell you the default values, as well as the limits.

For instance the FadeIn/FadeOut Time has a default value of 1200ms (1.2 seconds), and a maximum of 9999ms (9.999 seconds). The Color Transition Speed has default value of 250ms (1/4 second), and a maximum of 9999ms (9.999 seconds). Both of which are plenty of time to produce a nice effect.

The limits help keep you from entering an invalid number or one that would have no effect.

= What if I don't know color codes? =
No problem, just click or tap in the color box and a convenient color picker will appear that will allow you to pick a variety of colors.
